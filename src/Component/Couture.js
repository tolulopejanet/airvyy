          Your Vision, Your Sketch! After our consultation, we'll craft a dress sketch inspired by your ideas. We'll share it via email or WhatsApp, and if needed, we'll make adjustments until it's just right. There's a non-refundable sketch fee, but it's deducted from your dress price.

          <p className="contentt">
          Creating Your Dream Dress: Once your design and fabric are approved, we start crafting your dress. If you're abroad or can't visit, we can make a mock-up dress for fitting. The production typically takes six weeks, but it may vary based on design complexity.

          <h1>4. Fittings</h1>
          <p className="contentt">
          Once the dress is partly ready, you'll be invited for a first fitting. Subsequent fittings may be necessary depending on the outcome of the first fitting to ensure a perfect fit of the garment, in some cases though a single fitting could be enough!
